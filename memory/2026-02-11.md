## Agent Team Build-out (P0-P5) + OpenAI-only migration

- Switched operational model strategy to OpenAI-only due to Claude usage limits.
  - Default model set to `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`.
  - Core cron jobs (Morning Briefing, Email Digest, Tech News, Webhook Summary) updated to OpenAI model.

- Implemented Agent Teams in OpenClaw config:
  - Agents: `coordinator`, `researcher`, `engineer`, `qa` (+ `main`).
  - Separate workspaces under `agent-teams/`.
  - Subagent allowlist configured from main.
  - Per-role tool allow/deny policies applied and tightened.

- Completed phased swarm operations setup:
  - P0: handoff contract + QA gate foundations.
  - P1: owner lock + task queue + standup tooling.
  - P2: metrics report + blocked auto-escalation + weekly velocity.
  - P3: auto intake + coordinator triage + dashboard render.
  - P4: release gates + escalation rules + PR checklist automation.
  - P5: task scoring + smart reroute + incident mode.

- Added/updated key files in `agent-teams/`:
  - `HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.yaml`, `README.md`, `task_queue.yaml`, `DASHBOARD.md`
  - scripts: `validate_handoff.py`, `claim_task.py`, `standup_report.py`, `metrics_report.py`, `escalate_blocked.py`, `weekly_velocity.py`, `intake_task.py`, `coordinator_triage.py`, `render_dashboard.py`, `release_gate.py`, `task_score.py`, `smart_reroute.py`, `incident_mode.py`

- Automation added via cron for team operations:
  - Agent Team Standup
  - Dashboard refresh
  - Coordinator auto-triage
  - Blocked escalation watch
  - Release gate monitor
  - PR checklist reminder
  - Queue scoring + reroute

- GitHub setup completed for `prempy-openclaw`:
  - Logged in with device verification.
  - Created repos:
    - `prem-worklog` (public-safe pushes only)
    - `webhook-server` (private)
  - Pushed agent-team P0-P5 and skill work to `prem-worklog`.
  - Initial webhook-server project committed and pushed.

- Skill/docs normalization:
  - Converted workspace SKILL.md docs to English.
  - Added new skills: `claude-model-selection`, `claude-vs-codex-selection`, `openclaw-agent-swarm`, `claude-code-mastery` updates.

- Reliability note:
  - User strongly prefers proactive progress updates; requested periodic progress communication and milestone updates.

## New preference/context (late session)
- Oscar asked for live status on "team design" progress specifically, implying expectation of a dedicated design/art track in the agent team.
- Current team has no separate `art` role yet (coordinator/researcher/engineer/qa only); next likely action is to add an art role and produce UI spec pack (screen map, component inventory, wireframe notes, design tokens).

## Durable preferences and decisions (late session)
- Oscar prefers **plan mode documents** in development-architecture format, not timeline/day-based phase plans.
- Oscar asked to prioritize understanding and using **OpenClaw native multi-agent/sub-agent primitives** over heavy custom orchestration.
- Agent-team alerting became noisy; Oscar requested cancellation of all agent-team notifications. Team-related cron alerts were disabled/removed.
- Oscar challenged proof rigor: wants executable proof with timestamps/artifacts, not status claims.
- For sub-agent monitoring, Oscar wants truthful runtime visibility and explicit evidence of real execution.
- Repo cleanup correction: Oscar explicitly does **not** want Money Manager removed; intent was to remove/disable only Agent Monitor-related team design where applicable.

## Durable preference update (requirements/planning)
- Oscar requires planning artifacts at high granularity: requirement detail should be "as detailed as possible" (build-ready, concrete fields/rules/acceptance tests), not high-level summaries.
- Oscar explicitly asked that planning include two concrete sections every time: (1) deployment plan and (2) work breakdown/assignment plan.
- Oscar rejects day-based phase timelines; prefers milestone/system development plans.
